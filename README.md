> Senior Back-End Developer | Blockchain Enthusiast | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/thaiscarvalhodev)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you will find various personal projects, developed for friends or as part of my continuous learning journey. Please note that professional code developed for companies like ODTech and others isn't available due to them being in private repositories. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Professional Experience

With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I've honed my skills in multiple languages and technologies such as Go(Golang), C#, Node.js, REST APIs, and both SQL and NoSQL databases, among others. I've led successful migrations, designed and implemented secure APIs, and managed both small and large teams.

In recent years, I've been fascinated by the world of blockchain and decentralized applications. I've had the pleasure of developing a decentralized application and a set of smart contracts for a client's rewards program.

## üéì Education

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Systems from Universidade 7 De Setembro, and I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in IT Project Management from Est√°cio University. Additionally, I've earned certifications in Blockchain from the University of New York and Programming with Google Go from the University of California, Irvine.

## üíº Skills 

- Languages: Go(Golang), C#, Node.js
- APIs: REST
- Databases: DynamoDB (NoSQL), SQL
- Other Technologies: Docker, Linux, Amazon AWS
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum

## üå± Interests
